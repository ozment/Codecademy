An if statement checks a condition, and it will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true

if else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.

We can add more conditions using else if statements

Comparison Operators can compare two values

The logical operators 'AND', ( && ), checks if both expressions are truthy.

The logical operator, 'OR', ( || ), checks if either statements are true - left to right

The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.

The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if else statements

A switch statement can be used to simpifly the process of writing multiple else if statements.
The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed with switch statement.
